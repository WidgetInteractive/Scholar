### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Scholar is sort of the spiritual successor to [Harven's Research Timers](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=521&so=DESC#info). While Harven's addon is outstanding (and I've been using almost since it came out), it's always had a few quirks that annoyed me, and a few features that I felt were missing. Thus, I decided to experiment with a partial fork that did what I wanted it to, and Scholar was born.

Scholar displays progress bars for all of the traits you are currently researching, along with a live timer for each. However... I've added a few things, changed a few things, and reworked a ton of the codebase (mostly to facilitate future functionality).

The settings panel has been completely reworked, pre-existing settings are now easily configurable (such as font and text style selection), a few things that weren't previously configurable now are, and those settings that require reloading the UI now have simple, builtin methods to do so.

Right now, Scholar doesn't do much that Harven's Research Timers doesn't, but I want to take it a lot farther... I want it to be a full-scale, modular crafting and research enhancement addon. But, to do that, I need feedback! What can be improved with the existing setup? What would you like to see added? Let me know, and I'll see what I can do!
